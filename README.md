# Lab 8 - Starter

Andrew Onozuka

Dropping this lab to focus on group project, as I already implemented the Jest framework into our team's CI/CD pipeline 2 weeks ago. I intend to come back to this lab as needed to update our testing as development of our project continues, but at the moment I will use my lab drop. Thank you!
